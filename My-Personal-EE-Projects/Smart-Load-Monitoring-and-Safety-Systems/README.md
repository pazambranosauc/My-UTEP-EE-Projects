# Project 7: Smart Load Monitoring and Safety Sytems

## Description
Electrical equipment failures are often preceded by overcurrent and thermal stress. In field and plant environments, engineers need a portable, fast, and safe way to assess load health without permanent instrumentation.
Objective: Design a compact system that monitors current, voltage, temperature, and power, detects unsafe conditions, and disconnects the load when thresholds are exceeded.
