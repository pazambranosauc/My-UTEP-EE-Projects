# Project 7: Smart Load Monitoring and Safety Sytems

## Description
Electrical equipment failures are often preceded by overcurrent and thermal stress. In field and plant environments, engineers need a portable, fast, and safe way to assess load health without permanent instrumentation.
Objective: Design a compact system that monitors current, voltage, temperature, and power, detects unsafe conditions, and disconnects the load when thresholds are exceeded.

## Features
- Current measuring and displaying to know mechanical load / fault.
- Volage measuring and displaying to know supply health.
- Temperature measuring and displaying to know thermal stress.
- Power measuring and displaying to know energy usage.
- Relay Control to disable the load when unsafty conditions are reached.

## Building
This is my first ESP32 project and first time using ESPRESIF IDF which considerably made this projec harder and longer time wise for me. 
Even working with OLED display screen was a little bit of a headache, which is why I added the IDF installation section and OLED setup section to help explain others in case you face similar issues.
