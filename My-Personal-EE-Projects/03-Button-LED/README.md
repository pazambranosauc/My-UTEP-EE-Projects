# Project 3: Button LED

## Description
In this project I used the functionality of a button to turn a LED on in two different ways.
They both have the same wiring the only thing that changes is the code. The first one, (Button_LED_1)
turns on only while the button is being pressed. The second one turns on once pressed and stays on until
it is pressed again.

## Components
- Arduino UNO
- USB cable or USBasp programmer
- 1 Green LED ( Pin 13 → 220Ω Resistor → LED → GND)
- 1 220 Ohms resistor
- 1 10k Ohms resistor
- 6 jumper cables
- 1 Button ( Top right pin to pin 2, Bottom left pin to 5v source, and Bottom right pin → 10k Ohms resistor → GND

## What I Learned
- The right wiring of a button
- Activate a button to do something
- Change a button to its toggle mode
