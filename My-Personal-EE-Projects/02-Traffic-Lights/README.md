# Project 2: Traffic Lights

## Description
This project was just to play around with the already learnt fuctions from the previous project.
This program first turns on the green_LED for five seconds and then turns it off.
Then turns the yellow_LED on instantly for half second and turns of, this happens three times.
Finally, it turns on the red_LED, and after five seconds it turns off. Then the cycle repeats.

## Components
- Arduino UNO
- USB cable or USBasp programmer
- 1 Green LED (pin 11)
- 1 Yellow LED (pin 12)
- 1 Red LED (pin 13)
- 3 220 Ohms resistors
- 4 jumper cables (one for each LED and one for ground)

## What I Learned
- LED's of different colors have different voltage requirements. Since the red LED requires
  less voltage (1.8 volts), it brights more than the yellow LED wich requires more voltage
  (2.1 volts), even while recieveng the same amount of voltage.
