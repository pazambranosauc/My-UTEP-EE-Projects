# Project 1: EE calculator with keypad

## Description
I wanted to try something different and bulit this basic calculator for Electrical Engineers. This EE calculator consists of 3 modes for now.
Mode 1 is a simple arithmetic calculator with the operator +, -, *, /, which will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Then Mode 2 which is 
to facilitate adding parallel resitors since it already inverses it and the addition of them. Finally Mode 3, and Ohm's Law calculator, you
select the variable you are looking for and then give the variables you already know. To go back to the menu click "C" and for a reult "#".
I am looking forward to input more operators, decimals, and adding more mode for more complex formulas or operations.

## Components
- Arduino UNO
- USB cable (Make readings and display text on the LCD screen)
- Breadboard
- Keypad
- LCD Screen
- 4 Male-to-Female jumper wires (for LCD connection)
- 8 Jumper wires 
- USBasp (to upload code with programmer)

## Component Wiring
-  Keypad:
          1 → pin A0
          2 → pin A1
          3 → pin A2
          4 → pin A3
          5 → pin 2
          6 → pin 3
          7 → pin 4
          8 → pin 5
-  LCD screen:
          GND → Ground
          VCC → V source or 5v
          SDA → A4
          SCL → A5

## What I Learned
- How to wire and set up the Keypad's code
- Take input from the keypad and convert it into calculations
- Working with C++ math
- Working and eperimenting with for loops in C++ in actual projects.
